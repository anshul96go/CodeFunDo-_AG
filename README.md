I would focus on the prevention or mitigation part of the problem.
As we saw in the case of recent case of Kerala floods and other incidents of Hurricane in US, it is important to quantify in real time how much aid and what type of ai is required in different parts of afected region and the pace of various factors spreading like diseases, in addition to also keep in mind the resources and safe spots available and how rapidly they are getting endangered.
The broad idea to aid in part to all this problem is to use the twitter tweets data and SMS data (tentative to availablility) to get the idea of how many people are in danger or how much aid in what respect is required. As the Game theory says that all would exaggerate to varying contexts the issue, but that can be resolved by combining the satellite imagery data to compare the relief aked and needed. On the basis of two, the rescue operations could be ranked for various regions and suitable aid is sent. In simple terms, I would use the data from twitter and SMS data(or any other related data of communication) and get an idea of demand of aid and what are the expected number of people in aid. Then, I use the geographical data and club it with previous data to order the affected areas in terms of aid to be supplied and also the type of aid required, like food or medical or airlift, etc. 
Other part of my work would be to monitor the spread of calamity and its benefactors like diseases and determine the rate at which safe areas are reducing and thus order them in terms of aid work required or may require in future. Thus, it would help in planning in advance for upcoming situations. 
As I know both the safe areas and affected areas and the level of danger in both, I could return the information of safe spaces to affected.
Though all this seems too ambitioius, I would try to cover up as much as possible.
Thats all folks!!
